                While browsing a local flea market, I stumbled upon an older HHKB, specifically the Lite 2, and 
                decided to barter for it. The piece caught my eye due to its unique layout and classic 
                color scheme. Unfortunately, the Lite 2 uses rubber domes, but I was willing to look past that
                as this seemed a fun opportunity.

                To begin the restoration, I disassembled and thoroughly cleaned every part of the keyboard.
                In order to revert the keys and shell back to their original color, I followed the steps in
                this <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdWRsjnVD3s" target="_blank">video</a> 
                by Odd Experiments. Essentially, the yellowing is due to the degradation of the polymers
                in the plastic, which can be sped up by UV light. If the plastics are submerged in a chemical like 
                hydrogen peroxide and exposed to more UV light, the yellowing effect can be reverted significantly.
                The process can take several hours depending on desired results, so I left the H202 bath in my 
                closet in order to avoid eye damage from the UV light.
