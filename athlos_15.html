                For this project I worked with a previous colleague to develop a
                prototype for an exercise tool. He had an initial prototype based on 
                off-the-shelf components and wanted a custom version that would be
                cost-effective, easily transportable, and mass-producible.   
                <br><br>
                I designed the schematics for all of the hardware using KiCad.
                The main elements of this design included thermal control of a cooling element that
                was connected to the aluminum handle, monitoring of multiple temperature sensors,
                charging and monitoring of a Li-ion battery, and peripherals for user interaction.
