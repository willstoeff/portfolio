                I am an embedded firmware/hardware engineer located in the greater Boston area. 
                During my career I have worked on various projects ranging from battery-powered wearables to
                industrial automation instruments. I specialize in early-phase prototyping, turning ideas
                into functional devices.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time I enjoy playing squash and tennis, personal projects, and cooking. Check out the food
                link on the front page to see some of my more *aesthetic* meals.
